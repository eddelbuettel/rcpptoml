Title: 'Rcpp' Bindings to Parser for Tom's Obvious Markup Language
Version: 0.0.5
Date: 2015-12-19
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to
 "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format (described at
 <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>) suitable for both human editing as well
 as the common uses of a machine-readable format. This package uses 'Rcpp' to
 connect the 'cpptoml' parser written by Chase Geigle (in modern C++11) to R. 
SystemRequirements: A C++11 compiler. Version 4.6.* of g++ (as currently in
 Rtools) is insufficient; versions 4.8.*, 4.9.* or later will be fine.
