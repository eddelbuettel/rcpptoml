Description: The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to
 "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format
 (described at <https://toml.io/en/>) suitable for both human editing
 as well as the common uses of a machine-readable format. This package
 uses 'Rcpp' to connect to the 'toml++' parser written by Mark Gillard
 to R.
