Description: The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to
 "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format (described at
 <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>) suitable for both human editing as well
 as the common uses of a machine-readable format. This package uses 'Rcpp' to
 connect the 'cpptoml' parser written by Chase Geigle (in modern C++11) to R.
