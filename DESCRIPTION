Title: 'Rcpp' Bindings to Parser for Tom's Obvious Markup Language
Version: 0.1.6.2
Date: 2020-11-30
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to
 "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format
 (described at <https://toml.io/en/>) suitable for both human editing
 as well as the common uses of a machine-readable format. This package
 uses 'Rcpp' to connect the 'cpptoml' parser written by Chase Geigle
 (in C++11) to R.
SystemRequirements: A C++11 compiler; g++ (>= 4.9.*) or newer works.
